# Mojib-Ribbon Net Revival

This is a revival of the original servers for Mojib-Ribbon (PS2), it includes all functionality of the original server, although some things are missing (Like reject to connect if player connected with a diferent PS2 (?)) and there are some values that i dont know what they do. 

## Setting Up

To run the server, you only need Python, run main.py and the server should run normally.

To bypass the DNAS authentication, you can patch your ISO with [DNAS-net Patcher](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/dnas-net-patcher.22813/) or use this pnach code:

```
[Skip DNAS]
